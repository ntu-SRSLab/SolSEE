# SolSEE

**SolSEE** is a user-friendly source-level symbolic execution engine for for analyzing source code of one or several interacting smart contracts written in Solidity. SolSEE provides a Web-based user interface and improves upon existing source-level analysis tools by supporting advanced Solidity language features and analysis flexibility.

The key features of SolSEE can be summarized as follows:
- **Precise operational semantics.** SolSEE symbolically represents the configuration of smart contracts and executes each program statement based on the exact operational semantics for Solidity version 0.5.
- **User-defined harness function.** SolSEE facilitates examination and debugging of smart contracts by allowing users to define the harness function to control the function call sequence for verification. SolSEE can detect/report unsigned integer underand overflow, and check the validity of assertions, which can be used to specify custom high-level properties about the analyzed smart contracts.
- **Smart contract debugging.** With the symbolic paths generated by SolSEE, users can debug smart contracts. Users are able to visualize the execution details corresponding to the symbolic paths step by step in a Web user interface.

This repository contains the experimental dataset used for the evaluation ([/dataset](https://github.com/ntu-SRSLab/SolSEE/tree/main/dataset)) and raw experimental logs from running SolSEE and other source-level tools on this dataset ([/logs](https://github.com/ntu-SRSLab/SolSEE/tree/main/logs)).
